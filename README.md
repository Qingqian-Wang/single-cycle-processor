# single-cycle-processor
-In this repository, the fold "file" stores the main part of the single-cycle processor. It have 17 different kinds of instructions.
-In "final project" fold, we translate a c program tetrix to the mips instruction and store it in the imem. So we can use the previous processor to implement a tetrix game.
