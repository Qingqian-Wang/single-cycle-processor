# single-cycle-processor and tetrix
### In this repository, the fold "file" stores the main part of the single-cycle processor. It has 17 different kinds of instructions.
### In "final project" fold, we translated a c program tetrix to the mips instruction and store it in the imem. So we can use the previous processor to implement a tetrix game.
